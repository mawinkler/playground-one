# Scenario: Shift Left Security - Preview

## Prerequisites

- Vision One Container Security Artifact Scanner API-Key with the following permissions:
    - Cloud Security Operations
        - Container Protection
            - Run artifact scan
- Playground One EKS EC2 Cluster
- Vision One Container Security

Ensure to have the latest `tmas` deployed:

```sh
tmcli-update
```

## Scan Images

First, set the Artifact Scanner API-Key as an environment variable:

```sh
export TMAS_API_KEY=<YOUR API-Key>
```

> ***Note:*** tmas defaults to the Vision One service region `us-east-1`. If your Vision One is serviced from any other region you need to add the `--region` flag to the scan request.
> 
> Valid regions: `[ap-southeast-2 eu-central-1 ap-south-1 ap-northeast-1 ap-southeast-1 us-east-1]`

The `tmas` tools supports three scan variants:

- malware, -M          Perform a malware scan on an image artifact
- secrets, -S          Perform a secrets scan on an artifact
- vulnerabilities, -V  Perform a vulnerability scan on an artifact

You can either choose an individual scan type or combine multiple via flags.

To easily scan an image for vulnerabililies, secrets, and malware run

```sh
# Service region us-east-1
tmas scan vulnerabilities registry:mawinkler/uptonight:1.5

# If you Vision One is located for example in another region add the `--region` parameter
... --region eu-central-1
```

Scanning an image for vulnerabilities and malware simultaneously is as easy as above

```sh
tmas scan -VMS registry:mawinkler/evil2:latest
```

At the time of writing, the second scan should find 144 vulnerabilities, one malware, and a secret:

## Shift Left Security

Let's review the findings in Vision One. Head over to `Cloud Security -> Shift Left Security`. The two scanned artifact should be listed:

![alt text](images/sls-01.png "Artifacts")

We can now check on the malware and secrets tabs what has been discovered:

![alt text](images/sls-03.png "Malware")

![alt text](images/sls-04.png "Secrets")

Let's get more information on the secret:

![alt text](images/sls-05.png "Facebook")

Another malware example might be this:

```sh
tmas scan malware registry:mawinkler/malware-cryptominer-container:2.1.1
```

Scanning for secrets is very similar:

```sh
tmas scan secrets registry:mawinkler/secrets-container:latest
```

The two scans result in some additional findings:

![alt text](images/sls-07.png "Artifacts")

![alt text](images/sls-08.png "Malwares")

![alt text](images/sls-09.png "Secrets")

## Trying Deployments

Now, let's try to create a pod on our Kubernetes cluster. Check your Container Security policy since you really don't want containers with malware and/or secrets, or? 

![alt text](images/sls-10.png "Policy")

When trying to deploy the images our admission controller should block you:

```sh
kubectl run --image mawinkler/secrets-container:latest secrets
```

```sh
Error from server: admission webhook "trendmicro-admission-controller.trendmicro-system.svc" denied the request: 
- secrets violates rule with properties { count:0 } in container(s) "secrets" (block).
- unscannedImage violates rule with properties { days:30 } in container(s) "secrets" (log).
- unscannedImageMalware violates rule with properties { days:30 } in container(s) "secrets" (log).
```

As we can see, the deployment is blocked, which is as expected. The two `unscannedImage` logs come up since we only scanned the image for secrets. If you want, rerun the scan with the `-VMS` parameter which instructs tmas to scan for vulnerabilities, malware, and secrets.

Trying to deploy the secrets image again will result in the following (expected) deny:

```sh
Error from server: admission webhook "trendmicro-admission-controller.trendmicro-system.svc" denied the request: 
- secrets violates rule with properties { count:0 } in container(s) "secrets" (block).
```

Very similar with the malware image:

```sh
kubectl run --image mawinkler/malware-cryptominer-container:2.1.1 malware
```

```sh
Error from server: admission webhook "trendmicro-admission-controller.trendmicro-system.svc" denied the request: 
- malware violates rule with properties { count:0 } in container(s) "malware" (block).
- unscannedImage violates rule with properties { days:30 } in container(s) "malware" (log).
- unscannedImageSecret violates rule with properties { days:30 } in container(s) "malware" (log).
```

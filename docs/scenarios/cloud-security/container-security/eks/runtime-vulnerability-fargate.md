# Scenario: Runtime Vulnerability Scanning on Fargate

## Prerequisites

- Playground One EKS Fargate Cluster 
- Vision One Container Security
- Playground One Scenarios
    - Running app: Nginx

Ensure to have the EKS Fargate Cluster up and running:

```sh
pgo --apply eks-fg
pgo --apply scenarios-fg
```

## Disclaimer

> ***Note:*** It is highly recommended to have the `awsone.access_ip` set to a single IP or at least a small CIDR before deploying the EKS cluster. This will prevent anonymous users playing with your environmnent. Remember: we're using vulnerable apps.

## Overview

This scenario showcases the vulnerability detection functionalities of Vision One Container Security at runtime for EKS with Fargate profiles.

By the end of the scenario, you will understand and learn the following:

- Reviewing vulnerability findings and searching for a specific vulnerability

<summary>Click here</summary>

Head over to Attack Surface Risk Managemet and search for the vulnerability CVE-2021-3711

Identify the vulnerable deployment/container.

Find out the node(s) running the pod(s).

```sh
kubectl get pods -A -o wide
```

You'll see that the deployment is running within the `default` namespace. The name(s) of the worker nodes start with `fargate-ip-...` which indicate that these nodes are AWS managed Fargate nodes.

Checking the services

```sh
kubectl get services
```

tells us

```
NAME            TYPE       CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
nginx-service   NodePort   172.20.48.60   <none>        80:32443/TCP   26m

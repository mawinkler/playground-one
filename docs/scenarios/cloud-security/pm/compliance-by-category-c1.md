# Scenario: Compliance by Category with Cloud One Conformity

## Prerequisites

- Cloud One API-Key with the following permissions:
    - Conformity
        - Full-Access

The provided Python scripts will use the RESTful APIs to query the check results. The reporting of the compliance status may be limited by the number of days back in and a minimum level of criticality. 

## Playing through the Workflow

The scenario uses the python script `category_compliance_c1.py` located in the `cspm` subdirectory.

### Prepare

- Set environment variable `C1CSPM_SCANNER_KEY` with the API key and `REGION` to your Cloud One region.
- Get your `ACCOUNT_ID`:

  ```sh
  curl -s --location "https://conformity.${REGION}.cloudone.trendmicro.com/api/accounts" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
      --header "Authorization: ApiKey ${C1CSPM_SCANNER_KEY}" | \
      jq -r '.data[] | .id + ": " + .attributes.name'
  ```
- Adapt the constants in the Python script in between `# HERE` and `# /HERE` to your requirements.
- Lines 68ff. 
  ```py
  # HERE
  REGION = "trend-us-1"  # Examples: de-1 or us-1
  ACCOUNT_ID = "e37fe1b7-2b14-4b2c-96a4-db1bb2be8c8b"
  RISK_LEVEL_FAIL = "LOW"
  CREATED_LESS_THAN_DAYS = 90
  # /HERE
  ```

## Calculate the Compliance by Category

```sh
# Get the Compliance by Categories
$ ./category_compliance_c1.py --compliance
```

The script will produce an output like this.

```sh
2024-11-22 15:13:57 DEBUG (MainThread) [retrieve_bot_results] Retrieved 129 findings.
2024-11-22 15:13:59 DEBUG (MainThread) [retrieve_bot_results] Retrieved 329 findings.

2024-11-22 15:14:07 INFO (MainThread) [main] Category: Security - {'success': 682, 'failure': 375, 'compliance': 65}

2024-11-22 15:14:07 INFO (MainThread) [main] Category: Operational-excellence - {'success': 13, 'failure': 29, 'compliance': 31}
2024-11-22 15:14:07 INFO (MainThread) [main] Category: Sustainability - {'success': 39, 'failure': 93, 'compliance': 30}
```

We can clearly see, that the cloud account is 65% compliant from the security perspective, as an example. Similar the other categories.

The calculated results match closely with the Conformity view.

What we might also be interested in is how have we performed over the last 30 days? Have we introduced any new findings with a criticality of HIGH or worse?

For this, we change two variables in the python script:

```py
RISK_LEVEL_FAIL = "HIGH"
CREATED_LESS_THAN_DAYS = 30
```

```sh
# Get the Compliance by Categories
$ ./category_compliance_c1.py --compliance
```

The script will produce an output like this.

```sh
2024-11-22 15:29:30 DEBUG (MainThread) [retrieve_bot_results] Retrieved 157 findings.
2024-11-22 15:29:32 DEBUG (MainThread) [retrieve_bot_results] Retrieved 193 findings.
2024-11-22 15:29:33 INFO (MainThread) [main] Category: Security - {'success': 144, 'failure': 47, 'compliance': 75}
2024-11-22 15:29:33 INFO (MainThread) [main] Category: Cost-optimisation - {'success': 1, 'failure': 0, 'compliance': 100}
2024-11-22 15:29:33 INFO (MainThread) [main] Category: Reliability - {'success': 0, 'failure': 0, 'compliance': 0}
2024-11-22 15:29:33 INFO (MainThread) [main] Category: Performance-efficiency - {'success': 0, 'failure': 0, 'compliance': 0}
2024-11-22 15:29:33 INFO (MainThread) [main] Category: Operational-excellence - {'success': 3, 'failure': 0, 'compliance': 100}
2024-11-22 15:29:33 INFO (MainThread) [main] Category: Sustainability - {'success': 0, 'failure': 34, 'compliance': 0}
```

Apparently we have introduced 47 new security misconfigurations that we should check.

## Report Improvements by Selected Categories

Choose a desired risk level as the lower boundary and maximum age when the finding has been created.

Example:

`category_compliance_c1.py`

```py
RISK_LEVEL_FAIL = "HIGH"
CREATED_LESS_THAN_DAYS = 90
```

```sh
# Get the Improvements for selected Categories
$ ./category_compliance_c1.py --improve security,cost-optimisation
```

This will then create two files:

- improve-security.json
- improve-cost-optimisation.json

The individual file will contain all FAILED checks belonging to its category if they were created less than or equal to 90 days ago and have a risk level of at least HIGH.

If a check belongs to more than one of these categories, it will be included in the other output files as well.

`--improve all` will cover all supported categories.

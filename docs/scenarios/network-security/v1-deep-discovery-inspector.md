# Scenario: Deploying Deep Discovery Inspector on AWS

!!! warning "NOT FINISHED YET"

## Traffic Mirror on AWS

In an on-premises environment, you would connect the data port of a Deep Discovery Inspector to a single mirror port to capture all traffic on that switch.

In AWS, you can achieve similar functionality to a switch mirror port by using Traffic Mirroring on Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). This feature allows you to capture and inspect network traffic by mirroring it to another interface running monitoring software, such as our Inspector. However, unlike physical switches, in AWS you must explicitly configure traffic mirroring for each ENI you want to monitor.

## Prerequisites

- Playground One Network
- Activated Marketplace AMI for Trend Deep Discovery Inspector BYOL
- A valid license key for Deep Discovery Inspector

You need to have activated the Trend Deep Discovery Inspector BYOL AMI in Marketplace once. To do this, on the AWS Console choose the service EC2 and navigate to `Images --> AMI Catalog`. Select the tab `AWS Marketplace AMIs` and seach for `Trend Micro Virtual Network Sensor`.

There should only be one AMI shown for your current region. Click on `[Select]` and `[Subscribe on instance launch]`. 

Now, check your Playground One configuration.

Verify, that you have `DDI - create Deep Discovery Inspector` enabled in your configuration.

```sh
pgo --config
```

```sh
...
DDI - create Deep Discovery Inspector? [true]: 
...
```

Ensure to have the Playground One Network up and running:

```sh
# Network configuration
pgo --apply network

# Instances configuration
pgo --apply instances
```

You will get some output generated, the DDI relevant section is shown below:

```sh
...
Outputs:
...
ddi_ami = "ami-0089a63d4c91694fc"
ddi_va_ip = "3.122.148.231"
ddi_va_pip_dataport = "10.0.4.45"
ddi_va_pip_managementport = "10.0.4.230"
ddi_va_traffic_mirror_filter_id = "tmf-0729a55b05120aedb"
ddi_va_traffic_mirror_target_id = "tmt-032ac48714893a91f"
...
```

Use `ddi_va_id` to connect from the Vision One console.

!!! info "Initial Authentication"

    The first time you authenticate to the DDI console, you will be asked for an administrator account. Use `admin/admin` for this.

## Test It

***VERIFY***

Connect to the `linux_web` instance

```sh
pgo -o instances

instance_ip_linux_web = "18.185.107.182"
instance_username_linux_server = "ubuntu"
s3_bucket = "pgo-id-bucket-vkdhir40"
ssh_instance_linux_db = "ssh -i /home/markus/projects/opensource/playground/playground-one/pgo-id-key-pair-51f2emm2.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ubuntu@18.194.28.64"
ssh_instance_linux_web = "ssh -i /home/markus/projects/opensource/playground/playground-one/pgo-id-key-pair-51f2emm2.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ubuntu@18.185.107.182"
```

```sh
ssh -i /home/markus/projects/opensource/playground/playground-one/pgo-id-key-pair-51f2emm2.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ubuntu@18.185.107.182
```

Now install `nmap` to trigger a simple detection with our Virtual Network Sensor.

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nmap
```

Scan the subnet

```sh
nmap 10.0.4.0/24
```

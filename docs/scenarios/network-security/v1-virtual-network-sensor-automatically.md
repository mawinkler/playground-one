# Scenario: Deploying Virtual Network Sensor on AWS Automatically

***Draft***

!!! warning "NOT FINISHED YET"

    Solve dependency with instances. Create Traffic Mirror Session in instances when VNS is enabled. 

## Prerequisites

- Playground One Network
- Activated Marketplace AMI for Trend Virtual Network Sensor BYOL

You need to have activated the Trend Virtual Network Sensor BYOL
 AMI in Marketplace once. To do this, on the AWS Console choose the service EC2 and navigate to `Images --> AMI Catalog`. Select the tab `AWS Marketplace AMIs` and seach for `Trend Micro Virtual Network Sensor`.

There should only be one AMI shown for your current region. Click on `[Select]` and `[Subscribe on instance launch]`.

Now, check your Playground One configuration.

Verify, that you have `AWS SG - create Virtual Network Sensor` enabled in your configuration.

```sh
pgo --config
```

```sh
...
VNS - create Virtual Network Sensor? [true]: 
VNS - Virtual Network Sensor Token [eyJhbGciOi]: 
...
```

Ensure to have the Playground One Network and Linux Instances up and running:

```sh
# Network configuration
pgo --apply network

# Instances configuration
pgo --apply instances
```

## Test It

Connect to the `linux_web` instance

```sh
pgo -o instances
 __                 __   __   __             __      __        ___

instance_ip_linux_web = "18.185.107.182"
instance_username_linux_server = "ubuntu"
s3_bucket = "pgo-id-bucket-vkdhir40"
ssh_instance_linux_db = "ssh -i /home/markus/projects/opensource/playground/playground-one/pgo-id-key-pair-51f2emm2.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ubuntu@18.194.28.64"
ssh_instance_linux_web = "ssh -i /home/markus/projects/opensource/playground/playground-one/pgo-id-key-pair-51f2emm2.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ubuntu@18.185.107.182"
``Â´

```sh
ssh -i /home/markus/projects/opensource/playground/playground-one/pgo-id-key-pair-51f2emm2.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ubuntu@18.185.107.182
```

Now install `nmap` to trigger a simple detection with our Virtual Network Sensor.

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nmap
```

Scan the subnet

```sh
nmap 10.0.4.0/24
```

```sh

Head over to XDR Threat Investigation -> Observed Attack Techniques.

Set the Risk Level to include `Medium` and Datasource to `Network -> Network Sensor`. The following detection should pop up:

# Scenario: Integrate Deep Security with Vision One

## Prerequisites

- Playground One Deep Security
- Playground One Deep Security Workload

The Playground One can provide a simulates on-premise Deep Security deployment. For simulation purposes it creates a dedicated VPC with the most commonly used architecture, private and public subnets accross two availability zones. 

Deep Security itself is located within the private subnet and uses a RDS Postgres as the database. The Deep Security Workload configuration creates two linux and one windows server with a deployed and activated Deep Security Agent. Some essential configurations in Deep Security are executed via REST. These are (amongst others):

- Creation of a Windows and Linux Policy with valid configurations for the security modules
- Activation of agent initiated activation
- Scheduling a recommendation scan for all created instances

For this scenarion you need to ensure to have the Deep Security and Deep Security Workload configurations up and running:

```sh
pgo --apply dsm
pgo --apply dsw
```

## Current Situation

- Deep Security is securing (simulated) on-premise instances.
- Since you want to move to the Vision One platform you start with integrating Deep Security with the platform.
- You want to get the benefits of XDR for your environment.

## Integration Workflow

**Vision One**

1. `Vision One Product Instances --> Add Existing Product`.
2. Choose `Trend Micro Deep Security` --> `Click to generate the enrollment token`.

3. Copy the enrollment token and save the token.
4. Click `[Save]`.
5. CLick `[Connect and Transfer]`.

**Deep Security**

6. Login to DSM Console as administrator.
7. On the Deep Security software console, go to `Administration > System Settings > Trend Vision One`
8. Under `Registration`, click `Registration enrollment token`.

9.  In the dialog that appears, paste the enrollment token and click  `[Register]`.
10. After successful registration, your Deep Security software automatically enables Forward security events to Trend Vision One and changes the Enrollment status to "Registered".

**Vision One**

11. Go to `Product Instance` App and verify the DSM On Premise being conncted.
12. Optionally install Endpoint Sensor to the instances.

## Install Basecamp Agent on Instances

First, lets get the ssh commands to access our servers by running

```sh
pgo -o dsw
```

```sh
 __                 __   __   __             __      __        ___ 
|__) |     /\  \ / / _` |__) /  \ |  | |\ | |  \    /  \ |\ | |__  
|    |___ /~~\  |  \__> |  \ \__/ \__/ | \| |__/    \__/ | \| |___ 
                                                                   
...
ssh_instance_linux1 = "ssh -i /home/markus/projects/opensource/playground/playground-one/pgo-id-dsm-key-pair.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ec2-user@3.79.102.108"
ssh_instance_linux2 = "ssh -i /home/markus/projects/opensource/playground/playground-one/pgo-id-dsm-key-pair.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ubuntu@18.195.62.150"
ssh_instance_windows1 = "ssh -i /home/markus/projects/opensource/playground/playground-one/pgo-id-dsm-key-pair.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no admin@18.153.208.157"
...
```

To connect to a linux instance via the provided ssh command copy and paste the commnd in your shell

```sh
ssh -i /home/markus/projects/opensource/playground/playground-one/pgo-id-dsm-key-pair.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ec2-user@3.79.102.108
```

On the Deep Security software console, go to `Administration > System Settings > Trend Vision One`

This tab shows the Basecamp agent deployment script for the supported platform types. First, select `Linux (64-bit)` and copy the script. In the shell on the connected server run `sudo su` to get `root` and simply paste the script.

```sh

[ec2-user@ip-10-0-4-236 ~]$ sudo su
[root@ip-10-0-4-236 ec2-user]# <PASTE>
```

and paste the generated deployment script for Linux

Similar for Windows. Connect to the instance and paste the windows deployment script to the console.  Ignore the error at the top. The agent will install just fine.

```sh
ssh -i /home/markus/projects/opensource/playground/playground-one/pgo-id-dsm-key-pair.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no admin@18.153.208.157
```

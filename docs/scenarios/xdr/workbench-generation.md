# Scenario: Automated Workbench Generation

***IN WORK***

## Prerequisites

- Playground One EKS EC2 or Fargate Cluster
- Vision One Container Security
- Playground One Scenarios

Ensure to have the EKS EC2 or Fargate Cluster including the Scenarios up and running:

```sh
# EC2 only
pgo --apply eks-ec2
pgo --apply scenarios-ec2
```

or

```sh
# Fargate
pgo --apply eks-fg
pgo --apply scenarios-fg
```

## Disclaimer

> ***Note:*** It is highly recommended to have the `awsone.access_ip` set to a single IP or at least a small CIDR before deploying the EKS cluster. This will prevent anonymous users playing with your environmnent. Remember: we're using vulnerable apps.

## Overview

Automated malicious actions are executed every full hour on your cluster which lead to detections in Container Security. This scenario is very similar to the OAT Generation, but focuses on generated Workbenches.

## The story

Several attack techniques will be detected after the deployment depending on your Container Security Runtime Policy. For full coverage enable all rules and set them to `Log`.

Since the attacks are executed every full hour there is no need to scroll through the generated Workbenches.

The first Workbench is mostly because of using Terraform creating the environment. Since this happens obviously bb

A simple but good demo Workbench is the `Compile Source File Code After Delivery in Container`.

Here, a `.c` file is dropped into the container which is then compiled by `gcc`.

## Goals

Review the detections in Vision One.

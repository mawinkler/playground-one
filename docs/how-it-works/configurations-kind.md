# Playground One Kind Configurations

The Playground One has a modular structure as shown in the following tree:

```
kindone
└── kind (4-cluster-kind)
    └── kind-deployments (8-cluster-kind-deployments)
```

The following chapters describe the different configurations on a high level, refer the the dedicated documentation for more details.

## Kind Cluster

*Configuration located in `kindone/4-cluster-kind`*

This is work in progress and not finalized yet. Useful for quickly testing out Kubernetes things :-).

# Splunk

Splunk is a big data platform that simplifies the task of collecting and managing massive volumes of machine-generated data and searching for information within it. The technology is used for business and web analytics, application management, compliance, and security.

Splunk is an advanced and scalable form of software that indexes and searches for log files within a system and analyzes data for operational intelligence. The software is responsible for splunking data, which means it correlates, captures, and indexes real-time data, from which it creates alerts, dashboards, graphs, reports, and visualizations. This helps organizations recognize common data patterns, diagnose potential problems, apply intelligence to business operations, and produce metrics.

Splunkâ€™s software can be used to examine, monitor, and search for machine-generated big data through a browser-like interface. It makes searching for a particular piece of data quick and easy, and more importantly, does not require a database to store data as it uses indexes for storage.

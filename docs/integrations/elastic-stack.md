## What is Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is the distributed search and analytics engine at the heart of the Elastic Stack. Elasticsearch is where the indexing, search, and analysis magic happens.

Elasticsearch provides near real-time search and analytics for all types of data. Whether you have structured or unstructured text, numerical data, or geospatial data, Elasticsearch can efficiently store and index it in a way that supports fast searches. You can go far beyond simple data retrieval and aggregate information to discover trends and patterns in your data. And as your data and query volume grows, the distributed nature of Elasticsearch enables your deployment to grow seamlessly right along with it.

## Kibana - your window into Elastic

Kibana enables you to give shape to your data and navigate the Elastic Stack. Kibana enables you to interactively explore, visualize, and share insights into your data and manage and monitor the stack. 

With Kibana, you can:

- Search, observe, and protect your data. From discovering documents to analyzing logs to finding security vulnerabilities, Kibana is your portal for accessing these capabilities and more.
- Analyze your data. Search for hidden insights, visualize what youâ€™ve found in charts, gauges, maps, graphs, and more, and combine them in a dashboard.
- Manage, monitor, and secure the Elastic Stack. Manage your data, monitor the health of your Elastic Stack cluster, and control which users have access to which features.

## Logstash and Beats

Logstash and Beats facilitate collecting, aggregating, and enriching your data and storing it in Elasticsearch.

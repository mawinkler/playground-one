# Vision One XDR for Containers

At the time of writing, XDR for Containers is in an early preview stage. Unless you already have an EKS cluster running whose VPC is connected to XDR for Containers you can create one from within the Playground menu. Choose `EKS-A  Elastic Kubernetes Cluster (Amazon Linux)` in this case. This cluster variant supports Application Load Balancing which is required for XDR for Containers.

You need to create a connection with XDR for Containers by going through the workflow in your Vision One environment.

> ***Note:*** This process will get easier with the GA release of XDR for Containers.
